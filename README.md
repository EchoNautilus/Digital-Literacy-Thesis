# Aggregated Tech Literacy Framework — Demo Repository

This repository contains supporting materials for an undergraduate thesis developing a technology literacy framework for Indonesia. Contents include:
- Chapter drafts (Chapter 1–3 PDF or DOCX)
- Survey instrument (sample questions & demo HTML form)
- Framework diagram (PNG)
- Example data (sample CSV responses)

## Demo instructions
Open `survey_demo.html` in a browser and submit a demo response. The page will download a CSV file that demonstrates how responses can be captured and exported for analysis.

> Note: This repository is a demonstrative scaffold; full implementation and large-scale data collection are scope items for future work.
